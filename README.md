## 🌌 What is CareerOS AI?

**CareerOS AI** is an AI-powered career guidance and placement readiness platform for **Class 10, Class 12, undergraduate, and graduate students**.

It combines stream guidance, resume intelligence, skill assessment, skill-gap analysis, job discovery, saved jobs, application tracking, AI mock interviews, and personalized dashboards inside one unified career operating system.

Most students do not fail because they lack resources. They struggle because their career preparation is fragmented across too many disconnected platforms. CareerOS AI connects the journey from academic decisions to placement readiness.

<br/>

| Skills are learned randomly | Skill-gap based preparation |
| Jobs are searched separately | Live job discovery inside the platform |

## ⚔️ Comparison With Existing Platforms

| Platform Type | What They Do | Limitation | CareerOS AI Advantage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LinkedIn | Networking and professional profiles | Does not guide student preparation deeply | Adds resume, skills, jobs, and readiness intelligence |
| Naukri / Job Portals | Job listings | Mostly opportunity discovery only | Prepares the student before applying |
| Internshala | Internships and courses | Focused mainly on internships/training | Covers school guidance, graduate readiness, jobs, and interviews |
| Resume Builders | Resume formatting | Limited career intelligence | Provides ATS analysis, skill gaps, and improvement direction |
| Interview Platforms | Practice questions or mock interviews | Separate from resume and job readiness | Integrates interview prep into the full career dashboard |
| Counselling Websites | Manual guidance | Not always adaptive or data-driven | Combines guidance with scoring, dashboards, and AI insights |

### Key Differentiator

```
Existing platforms solve isolated career tasks.
CareerOS AI connects the full student journey into one intelligent workflow.
```

<br/>

---

- Resume parsing and keyword extraction
